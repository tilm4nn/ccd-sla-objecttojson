CCD Training - Single Level of Abstraction - Object to JSON

This project contains the class ObjectToJson that can be used to
serialize an object to JSON.

The code is difficult to read because it mixes up many different
abstraction levels.

Goal:
Refactor the class that the differen abstraction levels are
seperated in different methods.
